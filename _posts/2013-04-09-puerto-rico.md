Sadly it's the last day of our Puerto Rican vacation. While we managed to not get
killed (and to not kill anyone, though it was close, see below) we did manage
to drink our weight in liquor, swim in the beautiful ocean every day, run a lot
(or at least Jake did), get lots of sun, and watch [RPDR](http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_5/series.jhtml) at a really cute
gay bar in a terrifying neighborhood (but like I said, we didn't die).

Our condo was lovely (thanks [VRBO](http://www.vrbo.com/)) and right on the beach in Isla Verde, San Juan.

Beautiful beach right on our doorstep.

On 4-7 we drove essentially entirely around the island from San Juan to Ponce in the south to Mayagüez in the west.

The drink in Jake's hand cost us $5 and contains no booze.

We hiked around the El Yunque rainforest.

On the way up to El Yunque we stopped at an awesome little cafe (El Dajao) and
had mofongo (local dish &ndash; stuffed fried plantain) served to us by the sassiest
retired dental hygenist.

Also, we nearly killed a man in while driving in Mayagüez.
