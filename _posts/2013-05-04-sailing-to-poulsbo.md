Sailed to Poulsbo with my wonderful husband, dad, Roland, John and Paul this
Saturday on a J105. Took about three hours to get there, half under sail half
under power, but only two hours to get back in ~15 knot winds from the NW.
Sailing down wind with just the main out we peaked at 9.2 knots! Fairly epic
sailing (particularly for the Sound) with 2-4 foot swells. Had lunch at Mor
Mor and the day was absolutely perfect.
